# Abstract

```{r abstract, child = 'abstract.Rmd'}
```

# Compile

The following paragraphs describe how you can obtain a copy of the source files of our manuscript describing reproducible workflows, and create the PDF. Either, you can go the 'standard' way of downloading a local copy of the repository and knit the manuscript file in R, or you can use the reproducible workflow as suggested and use Make to create a container and build the final PDF file in exactly the same virtual computational environment that we used to render the PDF.

## Standard Way

Requires: `Git`, `RStudio`, `pandoc`, `pandoc-citeproc` & `rmarkdown`.

Open RStudio -> File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Git

Insert:

```
https://github.com/aaronpeikert/workflow-showcase.git
```

Open `manuscript.Rmd` click on `Knit`.

## Using a Reproducible Workflow

Does not require R or RStudio, but `make` & `docker`.

Execute in Terminal:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/aaronpeikert/workflow-showcase.git
cd workflow-showcase
make build
make all DOCKER=TRUE
```

**Note: Windows user need to manually edit the `Makefile` and set current_path to the current directory and use `make all DOCKER=TRUE WINDOWS=TRUE`. We hope that future releases of Docker for Windows will not require that workaround.**

## Rebuild Everything

In case you experience some unexpected behavior with this workflow, you should check that you have the most recent version (`git pull`), rebuild the docker image (`make build`) and force the rebuild of all targets (`make -B DOCKER`).

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git pull && make build && make -B DOCKER=TRUE
```

# Session Info

```{r}
sessioninfo::session_info()
